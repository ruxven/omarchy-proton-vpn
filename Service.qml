// Proton VPN state for the bar widget.
//
// Two polls with different costs drive this:
//
//   * nmcli (~10ms) runs on a short interval and owns the bar icon. The CLI
//     names its tunnel "ProtonVPN <server>" on device proton0, so this alone
//     answers "are we up, and where" without paying for the Python CLI.
//   * `protonvpn status` (~1s of Python start-up) runs only when the panel is
//     open, on demand, and after an action, it supplies the detail rows.
//
// `protonvpn connect` blocks for 30-60s, so every action is optimistic:
// _desired pins the UI to the requested state until reality agrees.
//
// Every subprocess is an argv list. The one place a value crosses a shell
// boundary is sign-in, where the username is whitelisted and single-quoted
// before it reaches the terminal launcher.
